              <br>
                I was born and raised in Vietnam. I used to be a fashion
                designer when I was in high school. So I believe that I
                have a great artistic sense and extensive experience in
                the design field. I’d like to work on various forms of Art
                in general. To me, my life is an adventure to discover
                the meaning and value of Art. I can never seem to stop
                creating new things. There’s always an idea, a new
                picture, or some business idea running through my
                head. I can’t help seeing a picture before I see words on
                it. I’m willing to facing the challenges in the future
                because I can learn from failure very well. After
                graduation, I plan to find an internship to sharpen my
                skill and earn industrial experience. My long-term goal
                is to build a fantastic personal brand.
